## 📦 Installation

### Method 1: Load Unpacked Extension (Development)

1. **Download or Clone** this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ghost-key-extension.git
   cd ghost-key-extension
   ```

2. **Open Chrome Extension Management**:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)

3. **Load the Extension**:
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the `EXTENSIONN` folder from this repository
   - The Ghost Key extension should now appear in your extensions list

4. **Pin the Extension**:
   - Click the extension puzzle icon in Chrome toolbar
   - Pin Ghost Key for easy access

### Method 2: Chrome Web Store (Coming Soon)
The extension will be available on the Chrome Web Store once published.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. **Create Your First Profile**

1. Click the Ghost Key extension icon 🔐 in your browser toolbar
2. Click "Create Profile" in the popup
3. Enter a profile name (e.g., "Work Account", "Personal", "Banking")
4. Set a training password (minimum 8 characters) - **this will be your actual password**

### 2. **Keystroke Training (5 Samples)**

1. Type your **actual password** exactly **5 times** when prompted
2. Ensure consistent, natural typing - this trains your unique keystroke signature
3. The extension captures both:
   - Your biometric keystroke patterns (for authentication)
   - Your actual password (for automatic login after successful authentication)
4. ML algorithms process your typing dynamics to create your unique biometric profile

### 3. **Voice Training (Optional but Recommended)**

1. Record the passphrase **"I'll Always Choose You"** three times
2. Speak clearly and consistently in a quiet environment
3. This creates your voice biometric fallback for enhanced security
4. Voice authentication uses the previously captured password for auto-login

### 4. **Seamless Authentication Experience**

1. **Visit any website** with a login form (Gmail, Facebook, banking sites, etc.)
2. **Focus on password field** - Ghost Key automatically activates with a brief indicator
3. **Type your password** - it's intercepted and analyzed in real-time
4. **Authentication options**:
   - ✅ **Keystroke Success**: Automatic login with your real password - no manual clicking needed!
   - ❌ **Keystroke Fails**: Voice authentication modal appears automatically
   - ✅ **Voice Success**: Automatic login with your real password
   - ❌ **Voice Fails**: Website closes after 5 attempts for security

### 5. **The Magic - Automatic Login**

After successful biometric authentication:
- 🔑 **Password field automatically filled** with your real password
- 🔄 **Login button automatically clicked** using multiple detection strategies  
- 🎉 **Instant login completion** - no manual interaction required
- 🔒 **Password cleared from memory** after 2 seconds for security

```

### Keystroke Dynamics Process

1. **Dual Capture**: Records both biometric timing patterns AND actual password
   - Precise keydown/keyup event timing (millisecond accuracy)
   - Actual password characters for automatic form submission

2. **Feature Extraction**: Calculates 32+ biometric features:
   - **Dwell Times**: How long each key is held down
   - **Flight Times**: Intervals between consecutive keystrokes  
   - **Digraph Timing**: Two-character sequence timing patterns
   - **Typing Rhythm**: Overall cadence and consistency metrics
   - **Pressure Variations**: Key press intensity patterns

3. **ML Analysis**: 5-layer neural network autoencoder:
   - Encodes biometric features into compressed representation
   - Reconstructs features and calculates reconstruction error
   - Compares error against personalized threshold

4. **Intelligent Decision**:
   - Reconstruction error < threshold = ✅ **Authentication Success**
   - Automatic login with captured real password
   - Error ≥ threshold = ❌ **Trigger Voice Authentication**

### Voice Authentication Process

1. **High-Quality Recording**: Captures audio with noise suppression and enhancement

2. **Advanced Feature Extraction**:
   - **MFCC Coefficients**: Spectral envelope characteristics
   - **Zero-Crossing Rate**: Speech pattern analysis  
   - **RMS Energy Levels**: Voice power and intensity
   - **Spectral Centroid**: Voice frequency distribution
   - **Audio Fingerprinting**: Unique voice signature creation

3. **Biometric Comparison**: Similarity analysis against stored voice profile
   - Cosine similarity calculation
   - Dynamic time warping for temporal alignment
   - Multi-feature weighted scoring

4. **Decision & Action**:
   - Similarity > threshold = ✅ **Authentication Success** → Auto-login
   - Similarity ≤ threshold = ❌ **Access Denied** → Website closure

### Automatic Login Intelligence

**Smart Form Submission** uses 5 progressive strategies:

1. **Explicit Submit Detection**:
   - `button[type="submit"]`, `input[type="submit"]`
   - Standard HTML form submission elements

2. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - Buttons with classes: `login`, `signin`, `submit`
   - IDs containing: `login`, `signin`, `submit`

3. **Text Content Recognition**:
   - Buttons with text: "Login", "Sign In", "Submit", "Continue", "Enter"
   - Multi-language support (登录, 登陆 for Chinese)

4. **Programmatic Submission**:
   - `form.submit()` method invocation
   - Direct form submission API

5. **Event Simulation**:
   - Enter key simulation on password field
   - Form submit event dispatching

**Password Security During Auto-Login**:
- Real password used for authentic form submission
- Automatic memory clearance after 2 seconds
- No persistent storage of passwords
- Secure logging (passwords displayed as asterisks)
